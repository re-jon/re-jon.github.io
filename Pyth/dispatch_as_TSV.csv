1860-11-01_article_71	1860-11-01	article	European Inconsistency.	;;; European Inconsistency.;;; The people of America, in that natural sympathy which they feel with the people of all countries, who are struggling to shake off alleged oppression, should not permit their enthusiasm to blind them to certain developments of the Italian contest, which afford a striking illustration of the real respect attached to principles of international law and national rights and independence by those who are most loudly prating of them, and who are eternally denouncing this country as a nest of filibusters and land pirates.;;; The fact that adventurous and roving spirits have gone occasionally from the United States to embark in such enterprises as those of Lopez and Walker, have been made the groundwork of the most sweeping abuse and denunciation of our whole country by the European press, and an English naval commander has played the part of policeman and handed Walker over to the executioner for his filibustering forays in Central America.;;; Whilst this abusive and bloody measure is meted out to our countrymen, Garibaldi is cheered on to the echo in his filibustering descent upon Italy, supplied by Sardinia, a Power at peace with Naples, with arms and soldiers, and backed up by English volunteers, who, no doubt, have done the hardest part of his fighting.;;; And all this has been enthusiastically applauded by the same public sentiment which denounces as pirates worthy of the gallows, and hands over to the executioner, such men as William Walker, who, what ever his faults, was a man of as much courage and talent, and engaged in quite as fair and practicable an enterprise as Garibaldi. But this is not all. Here is a significant item by the Canadian's advices: The Patriot says that ":Garibaldi has thanked the seamen of the English ship Renown, who served the Garibaldian guns on the 1st of October!;;; The men were that day on leave of absence." Observe the fact that whilst one English man-of-war is delivering one filibuster 10 death in the West, another is landing her men to fight the battles of a filibuster in the East.;;; Whether Garibaldi be a filibuster or not, makes no difference in this outrage upon national right and justice.;;; England is at peace with Naples, and the landing of trained artillerists from a British ship-of-war, to work the batteries of an enemy of Naples, is a flagrant act of treachery and injustice, which it will be idle to evade by the pitiful and unworthy pretext already prepared for the occasion, that the men were on leave of absence and acting for themselves!;;; Every one knows that they never could have obtained that leave of absence, under the circumstances of the times and place, without a design that they should take part in the contest, and that they would never have dared to take that part except with the assurance that it was agreeable to the wishes of their officers.;;; What would be said of a United States ship-of-war in Mexico, or Central or South America, if her officers should permit her men to land and work the guns in the battles of a faction in those countries endeavoring to overthrow the government Certainly, we should never hear the last of it, and would probably be threatened with European intervention to make us respect the rights of others.;;; We have no sympathy with European despotism; we should rejoice to see all Italy capable of being free; we loathe and detest oppression in all its varying forms; but even if the King of Naples be as great a tyrant as he is represented, does England pretend that oppression and despotism in one country justifies the interference of another?;;; This would be a new principle of international law, and one which, if well founded, she should hasten to apply to Turkey, Russia, Austria and Prussia, her faithful friends and allies.;;; Nay, more; if she should presume, as she dare not, to set up any such nonsensical apology as a vindication at the bar of public opinion, how would she relish its application to herself in the case of Ireland.--Suppose that impoverished and oppressed people, who have suffered at the hands of England a thousand fold more than the people of Italy have suffered from any of their rulers, should again revolt, as they have often revolted what would she think of an Irish Garibaldi? Let the gallows on which Robert Emmett and other patriots suffered answer!;;; And how would she regard the volunteering of Frenchmen, Italians and Americans under this Irish Garibaldi's banner; and what would she think of a French or American national vessel which should land its men, under pretence of a day's leave of absence, to work the guns of the rebels and batter down her strongest fortifications?;;; Yet this is precisely her own course towards the friendly power of Naples.;;; Let our countrymen remember these facts, and avail themselves of them for future reference, when we receive our periodical lectures from the London press on the forays which a few adventurers and misguided men, whom there is no power in our government or people to restrain, sometimes make from our shores.;;; There is also another fact which we wish our countrymen to bear in mind, that they may know how to appreciate the justice of the abuse which Europeans so persistently and audaciously heap upon the United States, in connexion with an alleged disposition of our Government as well as people to intervene in the affairs of neighboring and friendly States.;;; The accusation is equally groundless and malignant; but what is the example they set us?;;; The intervention by Sardinia in Naples, Sicily, and the States of the Church, is one of the most flagrant acts of national wrong and injustice recorded in the annals of history.;;; The Constitutional justly says that between the invasion of Garibaldi and of Sardinia there is a great difference; the one, himself a Roman, comes to lead the disaffected of his countrymen in their struggle against an unpopular government; but Sardinian invasion constitutes a direct intervention of one regularly constituted State in the affairs of another independent State.;;; Strange to say, Sardinian invasion took place without any declaration of war, the representative of the King of Naples still being at Turin!;;; Count Cavour gave it to be understood that the invasion by the Sardinian troops was principally directed against the influence of Garibaldi; now it has become evident that they go to aid him.-- We repeat, let Americans bear these facts in mind, and they will understand that when Europe calumniates the United States on account of its alleged contempt of the principles of international right and justice, it is not because Europe respects these principles, but because she hates our country, and is as malignant as she is corrupt, hypocritical and false.;;;

1860-11-01_article_76	1860-11-01	article	The times are changed.	;;; The times are changed.;;; In the course of conversation a few days since, a gentleman observed to us that he had been overhauling an old file of newspapers, in one of which he found the arrival of the Duke of Kent, father of the present Queen Victoria, at Boston, announced without the flourish of a single trumpet.;;; It was while he was Governor General of Canada, (we believe that was the office he held while in America,) and must therefore have been somewhere about the cross of the last century.;;; The royal visitor quietly took up his quarters with the British Consul, and attracted no sort of attention and remark, beyond a short newspaper paragraph or two.;;; Our friend entered into a train of reflections suggested by the contest between this species of reception and the series of ovations which sprung up as if by magic in the footsteps of his descendant, when he lately visited our shores.;;; It was very great, it must be owned, and yet it was not at all strange.;;; The Duke of Kent was but a King's son — the fourth in point of birth, and therefore a very distant expectant of the crown.;;; Between him and the throne, lay three others, big, burly, life-like, in the flower of life, the oldest not being forty years of age. Who could expect that young man to outlive all those sons of Anak, the gigantic George, the gigantic Frederick, and the gigantic William? In point of fact, though the youngest, he was the first of the four to die. But who could have guessed, that a child of his, even, would ever succeed to the throne of his ancestors?;;; All these young giants might marry according to law--one of them actually was married, and the Princess Charlotte was already born.--The chance of Kent, and his posterity, therefore, was beautifully small — like the small end of nothing whittled down, to use a phrase said to have originated with old Ben Hardin--so small that it was scarcely visible, and might be said, almost, not to have existed at all. Now, Lord Brougham tells us, that while the Prince Regent was carrying on his prosecution of his wife — endeavoring to get her decapitated by his Parliament — the people were stirred against him to such a degree of intensity, that had a tolerably popular Prince of the blood offered himself as an aspirant for the crown, he would infallibly have overset the older brother.;;; For many years before that trial — ever since he had been Regent indeed — he had passed along the same street every day, in his carriage, and had scarcely been noticed.;;; Yet no sooner had he been crowned, than the poor Queen and all her wrongs were forgotten, and the same people who had scarcely raised their eyes to look at the chariot and livery of the Regent, could scarcely be kept off the chariot and livery of the King.;;; Yet it was the same chariot, the same equipage, and the same man. So great is the difference between him who is merely a King's son, and him who is King in his own person.;;; Now, it is probable that the Prince of Wales in a very few years will pass through London without attracting more notice than his granduncle did when he was Regent, and that he will stir up the loyalty of John Bull afresh when be becomes King.;;; John has seen so many Kings and Queens that he cares not to look upon royalty in prospect. But Brother Jonathan, while he cares nothing for a man who is only a King's son, with no prospect of being King himself, satiates his curiosity by gazing upon the undoubted heir of royalty.;;; He never saw before a man who was certain to be King, if he only fulfilled the condition of outliving his mother.;;; This is the nearest approach he can make to seeing a King, and he makes the most of his opportunity.;;; The relative situation of the two countries (England and America,) was at the time (1799,) very different from their present relations.;;; We had then hardly recovered from the heartburning which the war of independence had produced.;;; But a few years before, the English had come from Canada, built forts within our borders, and instigated the Indians to make war upon us. So we thought, at least, and there seems to be little cause for distrusting our suspicions.;;; That war-loving Minister, the younger Pitt, was at the head of affairs, and it seems to have been a principle with him never to ask for anything in a civil manner, but to knock the man down first, and take what he wanted.;;; "Britannia ruled the waves" at that time, with a vengeance.;;; "Nelson was then Britannia's God of War," and he ruled the waves with a will.;;; He, and the Minister, and all their subordinates and understrappers, naval, military and judicial, firmly believed that no other nation upon the face of the earth had any rights of their own, and that all the privileges they enjoyed were so many grants from Great Britain, to be resumed at her own good pleasure.;;; Innumerable causes of quarrel necessarily sprung up with our neighbors across the Canadian line, as well as with John Bullon the ocean.;;; We looked upon them as they have always looked upon the French since the wars of Edward III., five centuries ago; that is to say, we regarded them as our natural enemies; and forty-five years of peace have not entirely eradicated that impression.;;; It is hardly wonderful, then, that the arrival of the Duke of Kent created no extraordinary sensation in Boston.;;; A few old Tory families, of pre-revolutionary times, were still in existence.--Doubtless these paid their duty to him, whom they considered the son of their lawful sovereign.;;; But the body of the people would have considered it, no doubt, unpatriotic, anti-republican, and derogatory to their character, for independent opinion and manly bearing.;;;

'Who, for example, makes your tea?';;; "'The housemaid, Hepzibah, generally; but sometimes old Oh'--Mary checked herself.;;; "'I beg your pardon--who?';;; "'I was about to name an old woman we have taken into the house to help the housemaid, but, for some reason I have not inquired, she does not wish it to be known.';;; "'Old Charlotte!' ejaculated Mawry.;;; "'Such is her name,' replied Mary, astonished at his astonishment.;;; "Mawry, who had sat down again, got up with a face white as ashes.;;; "'I — I have a word to say to Mr. Ainsley,' he said, and took a hasty leave.;;; "Charles was reading medicine in the Angel-room.;;; "'Good Heavens, sir!' exclaimed the little doctor, bursting in, 'do you know what you have got in your house?';;; "Horrid visions of his Mary in typhus fever — in small-pox — a lunatic — flashed like lightning across Charles's mind.;;; "'What--what ?' he gasped out.;;; "'Moll Murder!';;; "'Moll what?';;; "'The old bag to whom the boys in the town have given that title, for her strange association with every death that has occurred in this unhappy house since it became your uncle's. The very worst suspicions cleave to her. For mercy's sake, Mr. Ainsley, get rid of this old wretch before you are an hour older!';;; "Charles stood aghast. 'Is it — possible that'--;;; "'I know not what is possible; but do it, sir — do it,' said the eager apothecary; and Charles, infected with his earnestness, promised compliance.;;; "That night Charlotte was dismissed, this time taking her pattens with her, as though her work were done.;;; "'Touched and took!' was Charlotte's benediction, looking back and shaking her finger as she passed the door.;;; "Let me pass quickly over these sad details, The young wife was indeed doomed.;;; Drooping gradually, like the preceding victims, she slowly but certainly followed them to the same bourne.;;; "Ainsley would have left the house, but nothing could induce Mary to consent.;;; His uncle would be vexed; would think them careless, ungrateful — besides, they had no other home.;;; Most of all she earnestly desired, if die she must, to breathe her last in the Angel-chamber, with those glorious eyes and protecting arms above her.;;; "She had her wish; and, in a few short weeks, the fourth victim to the mystery of that house slept in the village churchyard.;;; "The popular feeling against old Charlotte had by this time attained such open expression, that it became absolutely necessary to investigate its grounds.;;; She was accordingly given into custody.;;; Some examinations took place; but the doctor being compelled to certify to a case of natural death, and no direct inculpatory evidence being adduced, the prisoner, on the very day of poor Mary's funeral, was restored to liberty, and immediately disappeared.;;; "It was now imagined that the house would be finally closed.;;; The next-door neighbor on one side had already quitted; he on the other had given notice.;;; Mr. Archbold himself felt his mind infected by the prevailing superstition; and, moreover, seeing the cause of misunderstanding removed, was ready enough to give indulgence to his returning kindness towards his nephew, to whom he accordingly wrote, desiring him to quit without delay the scene of his bereavement, and resume the place he had formerly held in his uncle's home and affection.;;; "Charles refused.;;; "He considered that his uncle, in placing them in a house under this notorious ban, had been actuated by less disinterested motives than he had imagined, and had been even in some degree instrumental in the fatal misfortune that had befallen him. Besides, he had a duty to perform, to which it was his fixed determination to devote every energy he possessed — nay, if needful, life itself.;;; He would find out the mystery of the haunted house.;;; And no knight, in quest of the holy grail, ever started on the doubtful way with more resolved purpose than Charles, when, returning from his Mary's funeral, he re-entered the desolate mansion.;;; "He was alone, absolutely alone; for poor Hephzibah, though attached to her master, and pitying him with all her honest heart, had evinced such unmistakable symptoms of aversion to sleeping another night in the house, that Charles, unshaken in purpose, judged it best to dismiss her at once to her friends.;;; So the door closed behind the sobbing Hephzibah, and Charles was alone, absolutely alone.;;; "For hours he sat musing by the melancholy fire, undisturbed by a single sound.;;; Evening at length approached, and still he sat, as though Memory had chained him hand and foot to the place where he had passed so many happy hours.;;; Gradually, he got into a train of recollection that conducted him through the entire history of his lost love, from the first chance meeting when he had stopped, a lost, benighted hunter, to inquire the road, and Mary's azure eyes glittered in the starlight, as if they belonged to it, while she stepped forward to his horse's side, and raised them in directing him. He had arrived at the evening when they had come, with their modest baggage and rustic henchwoman, to the magnificent house, had examined its alarming glories, had dined merrily, and were reclining in their deep velvet chairs, their laughing faces reflected grotesquely in the polished stove, up to the moment when old Charlotte, like an evil genius, appeared at the door.;;; "At that moment a sound struck Charles's ear — it was like a distant footstep somewhere within the house.;;; The door of the room in which he sat was wide open, and presently he was aware of a slow soft step ascending the stair.;;; "To say that Charles's heart did not accelerate its usual pace by a pulse or two, would be to deny a feeling that might have so far assailed the most collected.;;; An idea that the bold resolution he had formed was about to be met half-way, that the mysterious Horror of the House was actually approaching him in an incarnate shape, struck the listener with an appalling sense of being suddenly called upon to deal with what one cannot comprehend.--Charles involuntarily griped the velvet arms of his chair, and half rising, slowly turned his face to the door, where the step had halted.;;; "There stood old Charlotte!;;; "His fear melted into rage.;;; "'Wretched old hag!--accursed murderess!' he exclaimed, forgetting for the moment his own doubts of her guilt--'dare you'--;;; "'Charles Ainsley,' said the old woman, walking up to him, 'it is you who should not dare. I warned you — I warned your mother — I warned Mrs. Callender--I warned every one of you, young and old, of the danger hidden in this fearful house.;;; Yet I loved and served them all when they would let me, and to do so ran the same risk with them.;;; For reward, you have put the murderer's mark on me. I am the devil's mate, Moll Murder, the old poisoning witch.;;; My life is nothing; they might as well have hanged me. I hoped they would, for the Lord keeps justice for the innocent, and He knows that I never willingly harmed a living creature.;;; They were all touched and took, poor dears!;;; but not by me. I know you are come back to find out who killed your darling, and old Charlotte's come to help you.';;; "'You!';;; "'Like enough in some things,' said the old woman steadily. 'You've no more pleasure in life — no more have I.;;; You'have one object — mine's the same, only my reason's the best.--Find out what you may, you can't bring back the dead.;;; But I wear Cain's black brand, and that's an ugly mask to die in; I won't, If I can help it.?;;; "Charles stood looking at her with an amazement he did not care to hide; something in the woman's altered manner impressed him favorably, despite himself.;;; His thoughts held a rapid council; If the hag were guilty, and were really a prey to that fearful form of mania which could alone account for such cruel crimes, he had no fear for himself, and might even, by examination and analysis, obtain some clue to her alleged practices.;;; If she were innocent, she might afford him important aid in his investigations.;;; Some attendant he absolutely required.;;; In fine, he acceded to her proposal, and directed her to take up her residence in the house as before.;;; "A feeling he could not well define determined Charles to sleep that night in the Angel-chamber.;;; It was there that his Mary had experienced the first mysterious visitation — there, on his bosom, breathed her last gentle sigh.;;; "As he lay down, though with little hope of rest, he could not resist uttering a fervent prayer that the terrible influence might reveal itself to him; also — no matter with what peril accompanied — so that he might but analyze its fearful features, and gauge its destroying power.;;; "His desire was fulfilled.;;; It must have been about two o'clock when Charles woke, with a start, under the impression that a hand had been laid upon his face.;;; But such a band!;;; It could have belonged to no living human thing.;;; Horrible as it seems, it was like that of a putrid corpse.;;; His mouth, his nose, his eyes, his throat, were choked and smarting with some fearful effluvia, his pulse went irregularly — his very soul sickened within him!;;; "Ainsley was a man of cool, in trepid nature, and the strongest nerves.;;; Despite his confusion, he rose and wrestled with the Terror, as if it were a living foe that had nearly mastered him — a moment, and the victory was won.--Slowly and reluctantly, as though baffled in its assault, the horrible fear, whose presence be had almost felt,  relaxed its hold, and quitted him. Charles instinctively staggered forward, as in pursuit, reached the window, and throwing it up, gazed forth into the calm, cold night.;;; "'Whence, whence, O Horror!"he gasped.;;; "The next moment, with a countenance deadly white, he reclosed the window, and returned to his bed.;;; "In that instant, the Horror, the Ghost, had revested itself to him, as be had desired.;;; "But Charles would have further proof, and witness too.;;; "The following morning, after pretending to eat some portion of the breakfast he found comfortably prepared for him in the library, Charles summoned old Charlotte to a conference.;;; "She came, so changed, that her master could scarcely recognize, in the hale, respectable-looking matron before him, the wretched old outcast of the previous day. But I have said that Charlotte had, in common with other humble creatures I have met with, a way of brightening and expanding under certain influences, which revealed qualities hitherto wrapped in shade.;;; The troubles she had undergone, above all, the foul stigma under which she labored, had had a purifying and vivifying effect, so apparent in her manner and language, that Charles secretly congratulated himself on his ally.;;; 'He began by tracing as minutely as possible the history of the later illnesses and deaths, beginning with that of his mother, which event occurred during his absence abroad.;;; In this he received most material assistance from Mr. Mawry, for whom he sent during the morning, and who, after overcoming his astonishment at finding old Charlotte a member of the council, entered with all zeal into the inquiry.;;; "The result proved that the same extraordinary symptoms had been evolved in every case — namely, severe nervous, semi-cataleptic attacks, prostration of strength, mental depression, decay of the vital powers, and death — Mawry declaring himself utterly unable to account either for the origin of the disease, or for the rapidity and certainty with which, once conceived, it hurried the victims to their end.;;; "On receiving the information he had gathered, Ainsley was struck with one singular feature in the case — the predilection evinced by every patient in turn for the Angel-chamber.;;; It seemed a fatal fancy; for, certainly, whatever soothing influence it might exercise on the minds of the invalids, was not reflected in their bodies.;;; On the contrary, every one became rapidly worse, and the mysterious Terror — though its recurrence grew more and more frequent — seemed gradually to lose its intensity, in proportion as physical health declined, till it left the last days of the sufferer wholly undisturbed.;;; "'Now,' said Charles, as with a deep sigh he raised his pale face from his hands, after a minute's meditation, 'come with me, and I will show you the Horror in the House.';;; "He walked, followed by the others, straight to the Angel-room.;;; There it shone, with its regal couch, its superb mirrors, its glowing cabinets, its purple curtains.;;; Charles threw up the window, admitting the soft fresh breeze.;;; " 'Does this,' he asked, 'look like a pestilence palace — a house of pain and death?';;; "He struck upon one of the gilded panels as he spoke; it returned a hollow sound, like an echo of the last word, 'death !';;; "The next moment, Charles caught up a poker from the fireplace, and dashed in the panel.;;; " 'Stoop down,' he said to Mawry.;;; "The latter did so, but started back in horror, as a sickening, loathsome odor pervaded the apartment, as from a newly-opened grave.;;; "There lay indeed the secret of the Horror.--Out of that panel crept the unseen destroyer that had sucked away the breath, the life of no less than five victims.;;; "From the Angel-chamber, which had been originally intended as a luxurious bath-room, a pipe had been prepared, the other extremity of which had vent in the sloping bank of the adjacent cemetery, long since become one mass of corrupting human clay.;;; Thus, this fatal conduit, itself decayed, winding among broken vaults and mouldering mausoleums, gathered up the noxious exhalations, and poured them into the golden room.;;; By what atmospheric changes, or movements in the earth, the amount of miasma thus transmitted was governed and modified, cannot of course be known; but that the poison varied in quantity and strength, was sufficiently proved by the fact, that attention was never attracted to the vitiated atmosphere of the spacious and seemingly well-ventilated room.;;; "The panel which concealed the mouth of the pipe was low down — exactly on a level with the head of one sleeping in the Angel-bed, and probably distant from it but three or four feet. An almost imperceptible crevice in the thin panel must have projected that baneful breath into the sleeper's face as certainly, and, as it proved, as fatally, as the 'juice of cursed Hebron' dropped from the phial of the Danish regicide.;;; No marvel that the end was rapid ! To turn the face to that wall, was indeed to bid adieu to life, its hopes, its troubles, and its cares.;;; "Those most remarkable symptoms I have had to relate, can only be referrable to nervous temperament, or to the mysterious trouble acting almost in the nature of disease, until disease was positively engendered.;;; "When, on the previous night, Charles threw up the window, some slight odor eliminated from the burial-ground, connecting itself with the loathsome sense from which he had just escaped, at once revealed to him the latter origin.;;; "I gave you to understand, children, that this story was true; I now repeat that it is based on actual and melancholy fact.;;; "Many a child's banquet have I shared in that fatal chamber with my pretty May.";;; Professional Cards.;;;

1860-11-02_article_51	1860-11-02	article	Tragic affair in Boston.a young lady shot by her Lover.	;;; Tragic affair in Boston.a young lady shot by her Lover.;;; A tragic affair occurred in Boston on Tuesday, the chief actor being Jos. G. Hernandez, recently of Savannah, Ga., but for some time a storekeeper in Boston, and the victim was Miss Fanny May, a young lady of seventeen, whom he had met by appointment at a shoe store in Hanover street. The Herald says:;;; Miss May was the first to arrive at the store, and she was sitting at a desk in the rear part of the store, looking over some papers and doing some figuring.;;; Hernandez entered the store and was observed by one of the parties in the store to be talking with Miss May, and the next thing that was noticed was the report of a pistol, and Miss May was heard to scream and then to stagger back and fall to the floor.;;; After regarding her for a moment, Hernandez started to leave, but after taking a few steps he took a paper from his vest pocket, and swallowing the contents, threw the paper into the stove.;;; He then again cocked his pistol, which he had all along held in his hand, and placing the muzzle to his left side, just under the breast, he fired and fell.;;; At this time the young man in the store had in a measure recovered from the fright and agitation into which the shocking tragedy had thrown him, and he called lustily for assistance, which was soon at hand.;;; The scene in the store at the time was most tragic.;;; The attendant was imploring assistance with horrified eagerness, while on the floor, weltering in their blood, lay the bodies of the apparently murdered woman and her murderer.;;; Miss May was lifted into a chair, and it soon appeared that her hurts were not so serious as were feared.;;; The ball had struck on her forehead, and, glancing off, had made but a flesh wound, from which she will recover.;;; She was taken to the home of her relatives in a carriage.;;; Mr. Hernandez, when raised, was bleeding very freely, and was taken to his residence at No. 32 Leverett street, where the doctors expect he will soon breathe his last.;;; The wound made by the pistol ball is in the lower part of the abdomen, on the left side, and it is not believed that this alone will prove fatal.;;; The physicians fear, however, that the poison may have a fatal effect.;;; It has been ascertained that he took a dose of poison, and that the drug was arsenic.--After taking a small quantity, he threw the remainder, with the paper, into the stove.;;; A portion of this has been saved.;;; Mr. Hernandez states himself that he took the arsenic, and that he purchased it in Fall River.;;; It appears that four shots were fired, the first of which was directed to Miss May. He fired two across the room in rather a promiscuous manner, and the fourth he discharged with suicidal intentions.;;; Miss May is a second cousin of the wife of Mr. Hernandez, and for some years past has been befriended by her, and it was by her instigation that Fanny was employed by her husband to aid and assist him in his business.;;; For the term of two years past, Mrs. Hernandez states that she has been well aware of an improper intimacy existing between Miss May and her husband, and though as a wife she has felt justly indignant and hurt at this state of facts, still she contented herself with earnestly remonstrating with her husband, and discharging Fanny from his employ, which discharge she paid no heed to, nor did Mr. Hernandez insist on the discharge.;;; Thus matters have continued along until very recently, when Miss Fanny received the addresses of a young man in Lawrence, and became desirous of breaking her connection with her former employer, after having, as Mrs. Hernandez says, been the means of almost ruining him in a financial point of view.;;; The result of all this has been the terrible attempt at life which we have already detailed.;;; Its cause is most immediately explained in his own language just before the attempted commission of the dreadful tragedy.;;; It is stated in the following:;;;   Dear Wife:;;; --Forgive me for what I do.--Live for your children.;;; I have been as man and wife for two years with Fanny May. She has been the cause of this.;;; If Mr. Hall had not interfered this would not have happened.;;; May God bless you, my poor children.;;; I cannot live long.;;; I have been ruined in business by Fanny May. You will find some friends left when I am gone.;;; You need not be ashamed of what I have done.;;; Those who have ruined me will have to go with me.;;; Friend Slater, see me decently buried.;;; I am not afraid to meet my God.;;; Keep me as long as possible, and bury May and I.;;; Good  bye, Joseph.;;; Boston, Oct. 30th, 1860.;;; He was a middle-aged man, of a dark complexion, and was well known on Hanover st., as a dealer in fancy goods, and an active man. He had just concluded a purchase of a bill of goods, at a fancy goods house a few doors above the scene of the tragedy, and we do not learn that at this time he showed any signs of excitement or insanity, or that he appeared any other way than in his usual manner.;;; 
1860-11-02_article_52	1860-11-02	article	NO HEADER	;;; The Subtlety of Poisons.;;; --At a recent discussion before the Society of Arts, in London, on the detection of arsenical poisoning, Dr. Letheby traced the progress of toxicological research from the trial of Donald, in 1815, up to the present time.;;; A little while before that period, ten grains of arsenic were required to make a metallic test satisfactory in a court of law. Afterwards, Dr. Black improved the process till he could detect the poison if he had one grain to operate upon.;;; It was then thought a marvel of toxicological skill when Dr. Christison said he only required the 16th of a grain; but now we can trace the presence of the 250,000,000th of a grain of arsenic!;;; It is to be feared that the detection of this particular poison has reached an almost dangerous degree of delicacy, and extreme caution is necessary in examination for its criminal administration.;;; We live surrounded by means of unconsciously absorbing traces of arsenic; we breathe arsenical dust from the green wall papers of our rooms; the confectioners supply it wholesale in their cake ornaments and sweetmeats; the very drugs prescribed for our relief are tainted with arsenic; nay, more, even our vegetable food, as Professor Davy has lately pointed out, may be contaminated with arsenic; and there is probably no drinking water containing iron without a trace of arsenic as well.;;; The poison may thus be stored up in the system till, in the course of years, the amount becomes appreciable.;;;

The colonists usually manufacture about 5,000 dozen brooms annually, and the balance of the crop is sold at the East.;;; Of other crops, they have now on the ground about 2,000 acres of wheat; 2,000 of corn; say 2,000 of various other crops, such as sugar cane, potatoes, etc., and 1,000 acres of grass, Hungarian and timothy.;;; The whole estate is in admirable condition, showing unwearied care and excellent judgment on the part of the managers.;;; The stock of the domain is large, and the barns and sheds for cattle and broom corn are of mammoth proportions.;;;

An aid-de-camp was appointed to the spit, but the mischief was done, and when the reverend father had "blessed the meat, " he turned to the Dictator, and said, sternly, "General, the man who deserts his post in war time--" "Should be shot," interrupted the self-convicted Dictator.-- Letter in Daily Telegraph.;;;

A few months ago he removed to Clinton, on the line of the Buffalo and Huron railway, where his family are at present.;;; He came here on Saturday week, and at first appeared very unsettled, and told some of his acquaintances that this would be the last time they would meet — they had better shake hands.;;; The week passed on till Saturday morning, when he was noticed going into a field where some boys were burning brush, and sat down on the burning pile till all his clothes were burned off him. The boys gave the alarm, when two persons came and dragged him off, but he still persisted in going on. They tried to take him off a second time, but he threatened them, when one ran for assistance, and with some others, got him off, but he still wanted to remain on, saying that was his doom.;;; He was then entirely roasted, not a particle of clothing remaining on him. He bore it all without any signs of torture, and lingered on for about eight hours, when death came to his relief.;;;

As he suspected, she went home, took it, was very sick, and finally, calling her father, told him she was tired of this world, had taken strychnine, and had only a few minutes to live.;;; The father, after much persuasion, obtained the name of the apothecary and rushed to him. The latter received him without emotion, and in response to the anxious parent's inquiries, told him the circumstances, and explained that he had given her a dose which would only produce a very nauseating, and perhaps beneficial effect.;;; This proved true, the young lady, who was only about 17 years of age, being made very sick, and now having recovered entirely.--;;;

T., were traveling to the States, and on the evening of the 4th they were accosted by three Indians, who shook hands with them and appeared quite friendly.;;; After riding in company for a short time, the Indians rode ahead and disappeared.;;; When the white men approached the bluffs, near the Platte, they saw the Indians partly concealed, in the attitude of firing upon them.;;; They attempted to escape, but unfortunately were so near them that one of the white men was pierced with two arrows, and the horse of the other was wounded.;;; The Indians subsequently retreated a short distance, at the approach of other white men; but afterwards returned and captured the horses and baggage of these two men. The wounded man survived but twenty-four hours after receiving the wound.;;; The next day the war party of these same Indians murdered a boy of Louis Ganards, at the Mormon Crossing of the North Platte, thirty miles above this post, and stole four horses at the North Platte Bridge, five miles below the Mormon Crossing.;;; The murdered boy was at the time holding horses for his father.;;;

Surprised, after the lapse of a few minutes, in not seeing the crew come up, the mate again went forward and said, "If you don't come on deck soon the top-sail will blow away."

1860-11-02_article_117	1860-11-02	article	Uses and abuses of Agricultural Fairs.	;;; Uses and abuses of Agricultural Fairs.;;; In an article on this subject, the New York Journal of Commerce, after referring at length to the vast popularity and permanent advantages of Agricultural Fairs, mentions what it considers their abuses, in the various shows which have been admitted on their grounds.;;; The New Jersey State Fair is described as having been an amusing but odd exhibition of scientific, military, horticultural, animal and fantastic sounds and sights, whilst there was a "trial of speed," in addition to the other attractions.;;; At the Maine State Fair, the trial of speed was a horse race.;;; The Portland Argus gave a full report of the race "for the Society's sweepstakes" The public interest, even in the solemn State of Maine, seems to have been centred in that attraction.;;; There are few persons insensible to the beauty of blood horses, and the desirableness of improving and extending the race.;;; The throngs which assemble on that portion of our own Fair Grounds whenever the horses are exhibited, show the interest and popularity of such a show among our own people, and, so far from being an abuse, the horse show is considered here one of the greatest attractions and advantages of an agricultural exhibition.;;; It is true, however, that, with occasional exceptions, we have nothing which could be technically pronounced racing, the layers of that sport being in general magnificently entertained at the Fairfield Course, or at Ashland.;;; The late races upon that course, by the way, were worthy of the palmiest days of the Old Dominion.;;; The Journal pays a just tribute to the value of Fairs in general, "an institution almost as old as commerce," and which, in their application to agriculture, have been of great practical advantage to the farming interests.--The improvements introduced into them during the last half century; the agricultural colleges and institutions of a similar nature founded in this and other lands; the agricultural schools, where the art is taught in all its branches, having large farms attached, depending entirely on the students and professors for cultivation, and from which they repair to the recitation room to render the system of instruction complete by combining theory and practice, have all been followed by the most beneficial results.;;; And yet, as the Journal truly says, our countrymen are so far from perfection that they cannot even pretend to compete with the agriculturists of Europe.;;; But then it ought to be remembered that the despotic governments of the Old World give liberally to the support of agriculture, while this republican country, which has extended efficient protection to manufactures, and appropriated vast sums to the defence of commerce, has never appropriated a dollar to the agricultural interests, which constitute the occupation of nine-tenths of the American people.;;; The exhausting effects of our past mode of cultivation upon the soil, which is becoming worn out in all parts of the country, is a subject which demands the united attention of all the agriculturists of the land, and which might well demand the attention of the government.;;; We hear complaints from all sections of a serious falling off in the productiveness of the earth, which has been drained of its vitality, and no means adapted for its regeneration.;;; This matter will become serious before many years, and ought to be looked to in time.;;; 
1860-11-02_article_118	1860-11-02	article	The London press on the Prince's visit.	;;; The London press on the Prince's visit.;;; Some of the London journals, which had received advices of the Prince of Wales' arrival in the United States, are graciously pleased to signify their approval on the whole of American deportment on this trying occasion.;;; They express themselves in that characteristic style of dignified condescension and patronizing graciousness which arrested the admiration of Mr. Samuel Weller in the fashionable footmen at the "mutton swarry," and which, as that individual observed, is "werry pooty to look at. " There is some ill-nature in some of their allusions, which, considering the hospitable reception extended to the Prince would be somewhat offensive, but that we charitably attribute it to their envy at the superior degree of consideration shown by their royal master to the American sovereigns over his own plebeian subject cts. No British commoner ever presumed to shake hands with the Prince of Wales, and even the gallant officers of his squadron at Portland were greeted with a formal bow, whilst here the royal hand was freely extended to all his brother monarchs, in the most fraternal spirit.;;; No British lady can aspire to the honor of a dance with such a , whilst here our American Queens and princesses were recognized as all  to that proud social distinction.--No English journalist can approach the royal presence without fear and trembling, while here more than one of the press entertained and dined with H.R.H. in an agreeable and social manner.;;; We can easily understand, therefore, why some of the English newspapers are not so enraptured with the American reception of the representative of their government as might be expected.;;; We do not hold the Prince nor any of his suite responsible for the discourtesy of these journals, for all the royal party were delighted with the visit, except the footmen and other servants, who, like their brethren of the London press, considered this "a blasted country." The London Times is good enough to congratulate us on the opportunity we have enjoyed of seeing the "first gentleman of England," and certainly he is the first gentleman of that kingdom who ever made a flying trip through the United States.;;; With the exception of H. R. H., the Duke of Newcastle, Earl of St. Germane, General Bruce, and other noble gentlemen of the suite, most of the transient visitors from England to America have been snobs, of the first water, vulgar pretenders, who have given our countrymen a very unfavorable and unjust impression of English character.;;; We are happy that the Prince of Wales and the high-bred gentlemen in his train have enabled us to correct this impression, and we are sure they have left the kindest feelings towards themselves, personally, throughout the United States.--Prince Albert Edward, the London journals may be assured, is a universal favorite here, and it is a pity that many of his editorial subjects are not worthy, in character and manners, of such a Prince.;;; 
1860-11-02_article_119	1860-11-02	article	Handsome dividends.	;;; Handsome dividends.;;; As will be seen by an advertisement in another column, the Board of DirFire and Marine Insurance Company have declared a dividend of ten per cent. Out of the profits of the last six months, payable to the stockholders on the 15th inst., thus showing that twenty per cent, have been delayed for the past twelve months. With such dividends, it is not to be wondered that the stock commands a high figure at all times, and that very little, if any, of it is to be found in the market.;;; We think the dividends speak for the management in the highest terms of commendation.;;;

1860-11-02_article_123	1860-11-02	article	The city of New York.	;;; The city of New York.;;; This great American city is paying the unvarying penalty of success in the envy, spite and misrepresentation which are constantly rained upon her head, but which she dashes off with no more effort than the lion shakes the dew drops from his mane, or the Great Eastern scatters the opposing waters from her bow in empty froth and foam.;;; Whatever may be the peculiar defects of New York character, in a political point of view, that city is the most American city in the United States.;;; There is neither sectionalism of feeling, nor provincialism of utterance among the native population of New York.;;; We have heard it often remarked that it is impossible in conversation with an educated New Yorker to decide what part of the country he is from.;;; If it is possible to decide that fact by his sentiments of nationality, it is because New York is the most national of cities, not even excepting the seat of federal government.;;; Of course, these remarks do not apply to the immigrants from New England States to New York, who require a long residence there before they become nationalized either in sentiment or speech.;;; The weak points of New York are unfortunately prominent and conspicuous, and offer a ready handle to those whose inferior enterprise and want of success afford them no more substantial means of retaliation.;;; Her "upper ten thousand" are as ridiculous as her lower ten thousand are coarse and brutal, and she has more than her fair proportion of crime and ruffianism, simply because she is the great commercial city of this continent, the reservoir in which not only all the enterprise but all the villainy of the old world is first poured in America, before it is distributed to other parts of the country.;;; The politicians have availed themselves of that barbarous element which is to be found in all large cities, and thoroughly organized it into depraved and criminal train bands, nominating, in primary caucuses packed to suit their purposes, their own creatures for offices, whilst virtuous and respectable citizens abandon the polls in disgust.;;; The consequence is that, officially as well as socially, New York is made to present an aspect to outsiders which is at once ridiculous and repulsive, but as false to her real character as it is possible to conceive.;;; Between the upper and lower strata of New York society, may be found half a million of as industrious, intelligent and orderly a population as the sun shines on. The Duke of Newcastle, who, as well as all the royal party, must have been thoroughly nauseated with the intense vulgarity of the foolish aristocracy at the ball, were enthusiastic in their admiration of the New York People, who lined the vast thoroughfares of that city on the arrival of the Prince, the Duke declaring that he had never seen a grander spectacle.--We can well believe it. Soldiers and shows they had seen many times in far greater numbers than America could exhibit, but we doubt whether that or any other royal party ever before passed in review three miles of as wide awake, well dressed, and manly a population.;;; If the Union of these States shall ever be dissolved, there is at least one city in it whose skirts will be clear, and that is — New York.--From the first moment to the last of the Government, she can show a clean hand on that subject.;;; There never has been an hour when the taint of abolitionism or of treason has touched her heart.;;; At this moment, amid the boiling sea of sectional passions, she is the only firm and stable object in the flood, and stands the Pharos of the storm-tost shore, the constellated lights of the Union still shining brightly amid the surrounding darkness, and giving the only rays of cheer and guidance that now break upon the troubled sea. We predict that this patriotic and chivalrous metropolis will maintain its character to the last, and if she loses all else in this contest, will not lose her Honor.;;;

The Grand Jury is now in session, and is doing a big business.;;; To-day an indictment was found against a man named Dodson, for advising and inciting negroes in this State to rebel and make insurrection.;;; He was examined last night, and the proof was as follows, almost verbatim: Dodson was overheard to tell negroes in their cabin at a late hour of the night, "that the children of Israel were in greater bondage than they, (i.e., the negroes,) and that they threw off the yoke of slavery by themselves; that the negroes of St. Domingo had overpowered their masters and set themselves free, and that if they (the negroes of Virginia) would only be determined, and show that they were in earnest, the North would send them help; that there were 500 men in this county who would help them, and that many of the remainder would do nothing against them, and that in a short time they could all be free." Straws show how the wind blows, so I think this language, when used in the heart of Virginia, tells the tale.;;; I wish you would hurry up Anderson &amp; Co. in their armory arrangements.;;; We want some good shooting irons.;;; Company A, commanded by Capt. Wm. H. Werth, was out on last Saturday, to shoot for a beautiful medal.;;; There were only 69 shots fired (many of the company not firing,) and 56 were in the target, distance 80 long yards, and this with the old-fashioned musket altered to percussion.;;; When they get the Minute muskets, they will take the prize from any of your city companies, for most of the men can cut the cross with a rifle off-hand nearly every fire.;;; Lieut. J. D. Coles won the medal, his nearest shot being a quarter of an inch from the tuck in the centre.;;; It is now raining, and has been for several days.;;; Money is scarcer than hen's teeth, and no prospect of improvement.;;; Tobacco crop is enormous, and fine in quality.;;; Our Circuit Court will continue three weeks, and will then give way to our Quarterly Court, which will last for another week, and then leave half the business undisposed of.

Botts spoke in Portsmouth Wednesday night, At a Union meeting in Norfolk Wednesday night, resolutions were adopted, among which were the following:;;; That it is unreasonable to regard the elevation of any citizen to the Presidency, who shall be duty elected by a constitutional majority of the people, as an act of aggression, or from which, of itself, we may infer designs hostile to our rights and liberties.;;; That we have sufficient confidence in the people of the United States, in their love of the Union and reverence for the laws, to believe that they will, upon all just occasions, oppose and resist any clear violation of the Constitution, whether attempted in wantonness or under the forms of law. But we hold, that to anticipate and assume such violation, under existing circumstances, is at once unwise and unjust, and we shall regard the appointment of " minute men" and "committees of safety," as contemplated in one of the resolutions adopted by a portion of the people of the county of Princess Anne, on the 17th inst., as the exercise of authority unknown to the laws of the State of Virginia, and of an irritating and revolutionary character.;;; That we have seen nothing to justify any distrust in the constituted authorities of the State, that they will not in due time, and in a proper manner, vindicate the laws and maintain the dignity of the Commonwealth.;;;

The general dulness that prevails in the produce markets accounts for the comparatively light demand experienced for money.;;; The Boston Weekly Bank Statement. Oct. 3.--Capital stock, $37,731,700; loans and discounts, $63,822 0; specie, $8,089,500; due from other banks, $8,215,500; due to other banks, $9,070,700; deposits, $20,260,000; circulation, $7,543,000.;;; The Cincinnati Gazette of Thursday says:;;; "The movements in financial circles on Saturday, showed an increase in business, but this was caused chiefly by collections, a large amount of paper having matured.;;; This was promptly, and, judging from the comparatively meagre applications for loans, easily met. Nearly all the bankers reported a deficiency in the offerings of good commercial paper, as compared with the supply of capital.;;; The easy features of the market were, in all respects, fully maintained; but there was no giving way in the rates of interest.;;; As we are now upon the eve of the season when there must necessarily be an active demand for money, capitalists are not disposed to invest, except at full rates — say 10 @ 12 per cent. Within the next ninety days, $49,000,000 will be paid out in the West for hogs.;;; During the current month, therefore, the banks will have enough to do in supplying currency, to be used in driving hog and other products.";;;
