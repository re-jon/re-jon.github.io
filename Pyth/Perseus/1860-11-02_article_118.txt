#HEADER: The London press on the Prince's visit.
#TEXT: ;;; The London press on the Prince's visit.;;; Some of the London journals, which had received advices of the Prince of Wales' arrival in the United States, are graciously pleased to signify their approval on the whole of American deportment on this trying occasion.;;; They express themselves in that characteristic style of dignified condescension and patronizing graciousness which arrested the admiration of Mr. Samuel Weller in the fashionable footmen at the "mutton swarry," and which, as that individual observed, is "werry pooty to look at. " There is some ill-nature in some of their allusions, which, considering the hospitable reception extended to the Prince would be somewhat offensive, but that we charitably attribute it to their envy at the superior degree of consideration shown by their royal master to the American sovereigns over his own plebeian subject cts. No British commoner ever presumed to shake hands with the Prince of Wales, and even the gallant officers of his squadron at Portland were greeted with a formal bow, whilst here the royal hand was freely extended to all his brother monarchs, in the most fraternal spirit.;;; No British lady can aspire to the honor of a dance with such a , whilst here our American Queens and princesses were recognized as all  to that proud social distinction.--No English journalist can approach the royal presence without fear and trembling, while here more than one of the press entertained and dined with H.R.H. in an agreeable and social manner.;;; We can easily understand, therefore, why some of the English newspapers are not so enraptured with the American reception of the representative of their government as might be expected.;;; We do not hold the Prince nor any of his suite responsible for the discourtesy of these journals, for all the royal party were delighted with the visit, except the footmen and other servants, who, like their brethren of the London press, considered this "a blasted country." The London Times is good enough to congratulate us on the opportunity we have enjoyed of seeing the "first gentleman of England," and certainly he is the first gentleman of that kingdom who ever made a flying trip through the United States.;;; With the exception of H. R. H., the Duke of Newcastle, Earl of St. Germane, General Bruce, and other noble gentlemen of the suite, most of the transient visitors from England to America have been snobs, of the first water, vulgar pretenders, who have given our countrymen a very unfavorable and unjust impression of English character.;;; We are happy that the Prince of Wales and the high-bred gentlemen in his train have enabled us to correct this impression, and we are sure they have left the kindest feelings towards themselves, personally, throughout the United States.--Prince Albert Edward, the London journals may be assured, is a universal favorite here, and it is a pity that many of his editorial subjects are not worthy, in character and manners, of such a Prince.;;;
