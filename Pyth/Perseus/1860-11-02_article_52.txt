#TEXT: ;;; The Subtlety of Poisons.;;; --At a recent discussion before the Society of Arts, in London, on the detection of arsenical poisoning, Dr. Letheby traced the progress of toxicological research from the trial of Donald, in 1815, up to the present time.;;; A little while before that period, ten grains of arsenic were required to make a metallic test satisfactory in a court of law. Afterwards, Dr. Black improved the process till he could detect the poison if he had one grain to operate upon.;;; It was then thought a marvel of toxicological skill when Dr. Christison said he only required the 16th of a grain; but now we can trace the presence of the 250,000,000th of a grain of arsenic!;;; It is to be feared that the detection of this particular poison has reached an almost dangerous degree of delicacy, and extreme caution is necessary in examination for its criminal administration.;;; We live surrounded by means of unconsciously absorbing traces of arsenic; we breathe arsenical dust from the green wall papers of our rooms; the confectioners supply it wholesale in their cake ornaments and sweetmeats; the very drugs prescribed for our relief are tainted with arsenic; nay, more, even our vegetable food, as Professor Davy has lately pointed out, may be contaminated with arsenic; and there is probably no drinking water containing iron without a trace of arsenic as well.;;; The poison may thus be stored up in the system till, in the course of years, the amount becomes appreciable.;;;
