#TEXT: ;;; The Horror in the Housein two parts.part II.--concluded.;;; "On the point of leaving, Mawry turned round, and carelessly observed: 'I take it for granted, my dear madam, that you have an excellent watcher in your husband; but you need some care.;;; Who may I ask, is your principal attendant?'--Mary smiled. 'Who, for example, makes your tea?';;; "'The housemaid, Hepzibah, generally; but sometimes old Oh'--Mary checked herself.;;; "'I beg your pardon--who?';;; "'I was about to name an old woman we have taken into the house to help the housemaid, but, for some reason I have not inquired, she does not wish it to be known.';;; "'Old Charlotte!' ejaculated Mawry.;;; "'Such is her name,' replied Mary, astonished at his astonishment.;;; "Mawry, who had sat down again, got up with a face white as ashes.;;; "'I — I have a word to say to Mr. Ainsley,' he said, and took a hasty leave.;;; "Charles was reading medicine in the Angel-room.;;; "'Good Heavens, sir!' exclaimed the little doctor, bursting in, 'do you know what you have got in your house?';;; "Horrid visions of his Mary in typhus fever — in small-pox — a lunatic — flashed like lightning across Charles's mind.;;; "'What--what ?' he gasped out.;;; "'Moll Murder!';;; "'Moll what?';;; "'The old bag to whom the boys in the town have given that title, for her strange association with every death that has occurred in this unhappy house since it became your uncle's. The very worst suspicions cleave to her. For mercy's sake, Mr. Ainsley, get rid of this old wretch before you are an hour older!';;; "Charles stood aghast. 'Is it — possible that'--;;; "'I know not what is possible; but do it, sir — do it,' said the eager apothecary; and Charles, infected with his earnestness, promised compliance.;;; "That night Charlotte was dismissed, this time taking her pattens with her, as though her work were done.;;; "'Touched and took!' was Charlotte's benediction, looking back and shaking her finger as she passed the door.;;; "Let me pass quickly over these sad details, The young wife was indeed doomed.;;; Drooping gradually, like the preceding victims, she slowly but certainly followed them to the same bourne.;;; "Ainsley would have left the house, but nothing could induce Mary to consent.;;; His uncle would be vexed; would think them careless, ungrateful — besides, they had no other home.;;; Most of all she earnestly desired, if die she must, to breathe her last in the Angel-chamber, with those glorious eyes and protecting arms above her.;;; "She had her wish; and, in a few short weeks, the fourth victim to the mystery of that house slept in the village churchyard.;;; "The popular feeling against old Charlotte had by this time attained such open expression, that it became absolutely necessary to investigate its grounds.;;; She was accordingly given into custody.;;; Some examinations took place; but the doctor being compelled to certify to a case of natural death, and no direct inculpatory evidence being adduced, the prisoner, on the very day of poor Mary's funeral, was restored to liberty, and immediately disappeared.;;; "It was now imagined that the house would be finally closed.;;; The next-door neighbor on one side had already quitted; he on the other had given notice.;;; Mr. Archbold himself felt his mind infected by the prevailing superstition; and, moreover, seeing the cause of misunderstanding removed, was ready enough to give indulgence to his returning kindness towards his nephew, to whom he accordingly wrote, desiring him to quit without delay the scene of his bereavement, and resume the place he had formerly held in his uncle's home and affection.;;; "Charles refused.;;; "He considered that his uncle, in placing them in a house under this notorious ban, had been actuated by less disinterested motives than he had imagined, and had been even in some degree instrumental in the fatal misfortune that had befallen him. Besides, he had a duty to perform, to which it was his fixed determination to devote every energy he possessed — nay, if needful, life itself.;;; He would find out the mystery of the haunted house.;;; And no knight, in quest of the holy grail, ever started on the doubtful way with more resolved purpose than Charles, when, returning from his Mary's funeral, he re-entered the desolate mansion.;;; "He was alone, absolutely alone; for poor Hephzibah, though attached to her master, and pitying him with all her honest heart, had evinced such unmistakable symptoms of aversion to sleeping another night in the house, that Charles, unshaken in purpose, judged it best to dismiss her at once to her friends.;;; So the door closed behind the sobbing Hephzibah, and Charles was alone, absolutely alone.;;; "For hours he sat musing by the melancholy fire, undisturbed by a single sound.;;; Evening at length approached, and still he sat, as though Memory had chained him hand and foot to the place where he had passed so many happy hours.;;; Gradually, he got into a train of recollection that conducted him through the entire history of his lost love, from the first chance meeting when he had stopped, a lost, benighted hunter, to inquire the road, and Mary's azure eyes glittered in the starlight, as if they belonged to it, while she stepped forward to his horse's side, and raised them in directing him. He had arrived at the evening when they had come, with their modest baggage and rustic henchwoman, to the magnificent house, had examined its alarming glories, had dined merrily, and were reclining in their deep velvet chairs, their laughing faces reflected grotesquely in the polished stove, up to the moment when old Charlotte, like an evil genius, appeared at the door.;;; "At that moment a sound struck Charles's ear — it was like a distant footstep somewhere within the house.;;; The door of the room in which he sat was wide open, and presently he was aware of a slow soft step ascending the stair.;;; "To say that Charles's heart did not accelerate its usual pace by a pulse or two, would be to deny a feeling that might have so far assailed the most collected.;;; An idea that the bold resolution he had formed was about to be met half-way, that the mysterious Horror of the House was actually approaching him in an incarnate shape, struck the listener with an appalling sense of being suddenly called upon to deal with what one cannot comprehend.--Charles involuntarily griped the velvet arms of his chair, and half rising, slowly turned his face to the door, where the step had halted.;;; "There stood old Charlotte!;;; "His fear melted into rage.;;; "'Wretched old hag!--accursed murderess!' he exclaimed, forgetting for the moment his own doubts of her guilt--'dare you'--;;; "'Charles Ainsley,' said the old woman, walking up to him, 'it is you who should not dare. I warned you — I warned your mother — I warned Mrs. Callender--I warned every one of you, young and old, of the danger hidden in this fearful house.;;; Yet I loved and served them all when they would let me, and to do so ran the same risk with them.;;; For reward, you have put the murderer's mark on me. I am the devil's mate, Moll Murder, the old poisoning witch.;;; My life is nothing; they might as well have hanged me. I hoped they would, for the Lord keeps justice for the innocent, and He knows that I never willingly harmed a living creature.;;; They were all touched and took, poor dears!;;; but not by me. I know you are come back to find out who killed your darling, and old Charlotte's come to help you.';;; "'You!';;; "'Like enough in some things,' said the old woman steadily. 'You've no more pleasure in life — no more have I.;;; You'have one object — mine's the same, only my reason's the best.--Find out what you may, you can't bring back the dead.;;; But I wear Cain's black brand, and that's an ugly mask to die in; I won't, If I can help it.?;;; "Charles stood looking at her with an amazement he did not care to hide; something in the woman's altered manner impressed him favorably, despite himself.;;; His thoughts held a rapid council; If the hag were guilty, and were really a prey to that fearful form of mania which could alone account for such cruel crimes, he had no fear for himself, and might even, by examination and analysis, obtain some clue to her alleged practices.;;; If she were innocent, she might afford him important aid in his investigations.;;; Some attendant he absolutely required.;;; In fine, he acceded to her proposal, and directed her to take up her residence in the house as before.;;; "A feeling he could not well define determined Charles to sleep that night in the Angel-chamber.;;; It was there that his Mary had experienced the first mysterious visitation — there, on his bosom, breathed her last gentle sigh.;;; "As he lay down, though with little hope of rest, he could not resist uttering a fervent prayer that the terrible influence might reveal itself to him; also — no matter with what peril accompanied — so that he might but analyze its fearful features, and gauge its destroying power.;;; "His desire was fulfilled.;;; It must have been about two o'clock when Charles woke, with a start, under the impression that a hand had been laid upon his face.;;; But such a band!;;; It could have belonged to no living human thing.;;; Horrible as it seems, it was like that of a putrid corpse.;;; His mouth, his nose, his eyes, his throat, were choked and smarting with some fearful effluvia, his pulse went irregularly — his very soul sickened within him!;;; "Ainsley was a man of cool, in trepid nature, and the strongest nerves.;;; Despite his confusion, he rose and wrestled with the Terror, as if it were a living foe that had nearly mastered him — a moment, and the victory was won.--Slowly and reluctantly, as though baffled in its assault, the horrible fear, whose presence be had almost felt,  relaxed its hold, and quitted him. Charles instinctively staggered forward, as in pursuit, reached the window, and throwing it up, gazed forth into the calm, cold night.;;; "'Whence, whence, O Horror!"he gasped.;;; "The next moment, with a countenance deadly white, he reclosed the window, and returned to his bed.;;; "In that instant, the Horror, the Ghost, had revested itself to him, as be had desired.;;; "But Charles would have further proof, and witness too.;;; "The following morning, after pretending to eat some portion of the breakfast he found comfortably prepared for him in the library, Charles summoned old Charlotte to a conference.;;; "She came, so changed, that her master could scarcely recognize, in the hale, respectable-looking matron before him, the wretched old outcast of the previous day. But I have said that Charlotte had, in common with other humble creatures I have met with, a way of brightening and expanding under certain influences, which revealed qualities hitherto wrapped in shade.;;; The troubles she had undergone, above all, the foul stigma under which she labored, had had a purifying and vivifying effect, so apparent in her manner and language, that Charles secretly congratulated himself on his ally.;;; 'He began by tracing as minutely as possible the history of the later illnesses and deaths, beginning with that of his mother, which event occurred during his absence abroad.;;; In this he received most material assistance from Mr. Mawry, for whom he sent during the morning, and who, after overcoming his astonishment at finding old Charlotte a member of the council, entered with all zeal into the inquiry.;;; "The result proved that the same extraordinary symptoms had been evolved in every case — namely, severe nervous, semi-cataleptic attacks, prostration of strength, mental depression, decay of the vital powers, and death — Mawry declaring himself utterly unable to account either for the origin of the disease, or for the rapidity and certainty with which, once conceived, it hurried the victims to their end.;;; "On receiving the information he had gathered, Ainsley was struck with one singular feature in the case — the predilection evinced by every patient in turn for the Angel-chamber.;;; It seemed a fatal fancy; for, certainly, whatever soothing influence it might exercise on the minds of the invalids, was not reflected in their bodies.;;; On the contrary, every one became rapidly worse, and the mysterious Terror — though its recurrence grew more and more frequent — seemed gradually to lose its intensity, in proportion as physical health declined, till it left the last days of the sufferer wholly undisturbed.;;; "'Now,' said Charles, as with a deep sigh he raised his pale face from his hands, after a minute's meditation, 'come with me, and I will show you the Horror in the House.';;; "He walked, followed by the others, straight to the Angel-room.;;; There it shone, with its regal couch, its superb mirrors, its glowing cabinets, its purple curtains.;;; Charles threw up the window, admitting the soft fresh breeze.;;; " 'Does this,' he asked, 'look like a pestilence palace — a house of pain and death?';;; "He struck upon one of the gilded panels as he spoke; it returned a hollow sound, like an echo of the last word, 'death !';;; "The next moment, Charles caught up a poker from the fireplace, and dashed in the panel.;;; " 'Stoop down,' he said to Mawry.;;; "The latter did so, but started back in horror, as a sickening, loathsome odor pervaded the apartment, as from a newly-opened grave.;;; "There lay indeed the secret of the Horror.--Out of that panel crept the unseen destroyer that had sucked away the breath, the life of no less than five victims.;;; "From the Angel-chamber, which had been originally intended as a luxurious bath-room, a pipe had been prepared, the other extremity of which had vent in the sloping bank of the adjacent cemetery, long since become one mass of corrupting human clay.;;; Thus, this fatal conduit, itself decayed, winding among broken vaults and mouldering mausoleums, gathered up the noxious exhalations, and poured them into the golden room.;;; By what atmospheric changes, or movements in the earth, the amount of miasma thus transmitted was governed and modified, cannot of course be known; but that the poison varied in quantity and strength, was sufficiently proved by the fact, that attention was never attracted to the vitiated atmosphere of the spacious and seemingly well-ventilated room.;;; "The panel which concealed the mouth of the pipe was low down — exactly on a level with the head of one sleeping in the Angel-bed, and probably distant from it but three or four feet. An almost imperceptible crevice in the thin panel must have projected that baneful breath into the sleeper's face as certainly, and, as it proved, as fatally, as the 'juice of cursed Hebron' dropped from the phial of the Danish regicide.;;; No marvel that the end was rapid ! To turn the face to that wall, was indeed to bid adieu to life, its hopes, its troubles, and its cares.;;; "Those most remarkable symptoms I have had to relate, can only be referrable to nervous temperament, or to the mysterious trouble acting almost in the nature of disease, until disease was positively engendered.;;; "When, on the previous night, Charles threw up the window, some slight odor eliminated from the burial-ground, connecting itself with the loathsome sense from which he had just escaped, at once revealed to him the latter origin.;;; "I gave you to understand, children, that this story was true; I now repeat that it is based on actual and melancholy fact.;;; "Many a child's banquet have I shared in that fatal chamber with my pretty May.";;; Professional Cards.;;;
