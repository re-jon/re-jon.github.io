#TEXT: ;;; The Agricultural Fair.;;; --The receipts for tickets at the late Agricultural Fair, amounted to about $5,400. We have not ascertained the total amount of tickets and certificates of membership, but suppose it will not fail short of $10,000. Thus we have a proof of the successful result of the exhibition.;;; It has exceeded that of any previous Fair, and the anticipation of its friends have been fully realized.;;; If there were any who were deterred from coming, through expectations of a failure, we hope that they will not be thus influenced hereafter.;;; The meeting of the Executive Committee of the Central Society, announced for yesterday, did not take place.;;;
