#TEXT: ;;; Attempt of a young lady to Commit suicide;;; --She is made very Sick, but does not Die.--In one of our most flourishing suburban villages, a young man has recently established himself in the apothecary business, with a good degree of success.;;; A short time since, a daughter of one of the most prominent citizens of the place called upon him, and said she wanted to buy some strychnine.;;; He looked at her, and noticing marks of confusion in her countenance, had a vague suspicion of something wrong.;;; He accordingly answered by an evasive question, as to whether she knew that apothecaries were not allowed to sell poison, telling her that if she would bring the prescription of a physician it would be all right.;;; She answered, with a smile, that she only wanted to kill a cat; that she was somewhat attached to the animal, hated to kill it, and therefore would like something that would cause as little pain as possible, but would be sure death.;;; The apothecary did not like to offend the young lady, but still had his suspicions.;;; He accordingly mixed a preparation and gave it to her. As he suspected, she went home, took it, was very sick, and finally, calling her father, told him she was tired of this world, had taken strychnine, and had only a few minutes to live.;;; The father, after much persuasion, obtained the name of the apothecary and rushed to him. The latter received him without emotion, and in response to the anxious parent's inquiries, told him the circumstances, and explained that he had given her a dose which would only produce a very nauseating, and perhaps beneficial effect.;;; This proved true, the young lady, who was only about 17 years of age, being made very sick, and now having recovered entirely.--;;;
