#TEXT: ;;; Another royal marriage.;;; --The London Court Journal, has announced the coming betrothal of her Majesty's second daughter, the Princess Alice, to Prince Louis, of Hesse Darmstadt, a nephew of the reigning Grand Duke.;;; This union is only to be noted in a political sense, in as much as it will cement still more strongly the close alliance already existing between the royal families of Great Britain and Prussia, the bridegroom elect being, through his mother, cousin German to the King and to the Prince Regent of the latter Kingdom.;;; Hesse Darmstadt is by no means the smallest of the many German principalities.;;; Its area is 3,760 square miles; the population, eight years since, numbered 854,000; the army upwards of 10,000 men; the chief cities are Darmstadt and Mayence; the chief rivers the Rhine and the Neckar.;;; The personal qualifications of this young couple belong to the realm of gossip, which we do not desire to aid in extending beyond the enormous limits that it has recently attained.;;; But we may add that if in years -- 23 and 18 -- the pair will be fairly mated, so also is the match a suitable one in another respect.;;; We should scarcely care to see the fortunes of a daughter of England linked with those of Absolutism.;;; Hesse Darmstadt is a constitutional monarchy.--N. Y. Albion.;;;
