#TEXT: ;;; Garibaldi as a Cook.;;; --On the march up from Raggio, Garibaldi and his staff had contrived, after many hours' fasting, to procure a large joint of beef; this they proceeded to roast, the Dictator himself undertaking to turn an extemporary spit, (a ramrod,) while the others prepared the rest of the dinner.--One staff-officer in spurs, and wearing a heavy cavalry sword, was mildly cutting up tomatoes and onions, while a priest, of goodly presence, was mixing something in a tin pot; suddenly the holy man looked up from his labor of love and saw the meat burning, while Garibaldi, in deep thought, was walking some distance off. An aid-de-camp was appointed to the spit, but the mischief was done, and when the reverend father had "blessed the meat, " he turned to the Dictator, and said, sternly, "General, the man who deserts his post in war time--" "Should be shot," interrupted the self-convicted Dictator.-- Letter in Daily Telegraph.;;;
