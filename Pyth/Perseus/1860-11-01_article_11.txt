#TEXT: ;;; Over-worked women.;;; --An over â€” worked woman is always a sad sight; sadder a great deal than an over-worked man, because she is so much more fertile in capacities of suffering than a man. She has so many varieties of headache, sometimes as if Joel were driving the nail that killed Sisera into her temples, sometimes letting her work fall with half her brain, while the other half throbs as if it would go to pieces; sometimes tightening round the brows as if her cap bands were Luke's iron crown; and then her neuralgias, and her back aches, and her fits of depression, in which she thinks she is nothing, and less than nothing, and those paroxysms which men speak slightingly of as hysterical convulsions, that is all, only not commonly fatal ones; so many trials which belong to her fine and mobile structure, that she is always entitled to pity when she is placed in conditions which develops her nervous tendencies.--   Dr. O. W. Helmes.;;;
