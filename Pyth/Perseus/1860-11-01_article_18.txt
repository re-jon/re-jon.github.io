Kavanagh and White.--Mr. White was beaten by 132 points, the highest run in the game being 53, which was made by Mr. Kavanagh, who is a cool and graceful player.;;; The second game, between Messrs. Tieman and Lynch, was one of the closest and best con of any thus far played.;;; Mr. Lynch led off in some splendid runs, ranging from 74 to 16, but towards the close of the game his hasty but good-- natured antagonist was shined up, and when the game was even within a single point, made a splendid run of 85, and was proclaimed the victor.;;; On Wednesday Messrs. Kavanagh and Tieman will play, and as the prize cue undoubtedly lies between them, much interest is felt as to the result,--On Thursday Mr. Phelan will play a game of 500 points with the winner.-- N.
