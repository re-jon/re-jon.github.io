#TEXT: ;;; The Captor of Guadalajara --Sufferings of the Besiegers.;;; --The city of Guadalajara, Mexico, held by Miramon's forces, was captured on the 11th, by the Liberal party.;;; The N. O. Picayune says:;;; Guadalajara is the second city of the Republic, rich and prosperous, and has been defended with great obstinacy.;;; It has long been, moreover, the principal stronghold of the reactionists in that part of the Republic, and its capture is believed to open the way direct to the capital.;;; Our files abound in most touching letters from the besieged city, from which it would appear, as might indeed have been expected, that the suffering of the people was very great.;;; We learn, indeed, from a letter of General Ortega himself, that on the 1st inst.the suffering had become so great that the fire upon the city was suspended for a space of three hours, that women and children might leave the town.;;; How many actually left we are not informed, but it would appear that the number was small.;;; In all probability the poor people knew not what to do, and there for the space of at least twenty days, they remained huddled together in the centre of the town, farthest removed from the shots of the besiegers, suffering each hour discomforts and anxieties which must have been worse than death itself.;;; The correspondent of the N. O. Delta, writing on the 15th inst.from the city of Mexico, gives the following additional particulars of the suffering of the people at Guadalajara:;;; A deed of horror has come to my knowledge which surpasses anything of the kind that has ever been heard of: " A poor woman, with the view of favoring the escape of her husband, who had been forcibly taken as a soldier, went to the quarter where he was confined, taking with her some female apparel in which to disguise him. The unfortunate pair were discovered while endeavoring to make their escape, and three hundred lashes were ordered by the Miramon commandant to be administered to each.;;; The poor woman was enceinte; she received the three hundred lashes, gave birth to a child, and died in the most excruciating agonies.";;;
