Botts spoke in Portsmouth Wednesday night, At a Union meeting in Norfolk Wednesday night, resolutions were adopted, among which were the following:;;; That it is unreasonable to regard the elevation of any citizen to the Presidency, who shall be duty elected by a constitutional majority of the people, as an act of aggression, or from which, of itself, we may infer designs hostile to our rights and liberties.;;; That we have sufficient confidence in the people of the United States, in their love of the Union and reverence for the laws, to believe that they will, upon all just occasions, oppose and resist any clear violation of the Constitution, whether attempted in wantonness or under the forms of law. But we hold, that to anticipate and assume such violation, under existing circumstances, is at once unwise and unjust, and we shall regard the appointment of " minute men" and "committees of safety," as contemplated in one of the resolutions adopted by a portion of the people of the county of Princess Anne, on the 17th inst., as the exercise of authority unknown to the laws of the State of Virginia, and of an irritating and revolutionary character.;;; That we have seen nothing to justify any distrust in the constituted authorities of the State, that they will not in due time, and in a proper manner, vindicate the laws and maintain the dignity of the Commonwealth.;;;
