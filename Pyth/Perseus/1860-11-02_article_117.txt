#HEADER: Uses and abuses of Agricultural Fairs.
#TEXT: ;;; Uses and abuses of Agricultural Fairs.;;; In an article on this subject, the New York Journal of Commerce, after referring at length to the vast popularity and permanent advantages of Agricultural Fairs, mentions what it considers their abuses, in the various shows which have been admitted on their grounds.;;; The New Jersey State Fair is described as having been an amusing but odd exhibition of scientific, military, horticultural, animal and fantastic sounds and sights, whilst there was a "trial of speed," in addition to the other attractions.;;; At the Maine State Fair, the trial of speed was a horse race.;;; The Portland Argus gave a full report of the race "for the Society's sweepstakes" The public interest, even in the solemn State of Maine, seems to have been centred in that attraction.;;; There are few persons insensible to the beauty of blood horses, and the desirableness of improving and extending the race.;;; The throngs which assemble on that portion of our own Fair Grounds whenever the horses are exhibited, show the interest and popularity of such a show among our own people, and, so far from being an abuse, the horse show is considered here one of the greatest attractions and advantages of an agricultural exhibition.;;; It is true, however, that, with occasional exceptions, we have nothing which could be technically pronounced racing, the layers of that sport being in general magnificently entertained at the Fairfield Course, or at Ashland.;;; The late races upon that course, by the way, were worthy of the palmiest days of the Old Dominion.;;; The Journal pays a just tribute to the value of Fairs in general, "an institution almost as old as commerce," and which, in their application to agriculture, have been of great practical advantage to the farming interests.--The improvements introduced into them during the last half century; the agricultural colleges and institutions of a similar nature founded in this and other lands; the agricultural schools, where the art is taught in all its branches, having large farms attached, depending entirely on the students and professors for cultivation, and from which they repair to the recitation room to render the system of instruction complete by combining theory and practice, have all been followed by the most beneficial results.;;; And yet, as the Journal truly says, our countrymen are so far from perfection that they cannot even pretend to compete with the agriculturists of Europe.;;; But then it ought to be remembered that the despotic governments of the Old World give liberally to the support of agriculture, while this republican country, which has extended efficient protection to manufactures, and appropriated vast sums to the defence of commerce, has never appropriated a dollar to the agricultural interests, which constitute the occupation of nine-tenths of the American people.;;; The exhausting effects of our past mode of cultivation upon the soil, which is becoming worn out in all parts of the country, is a subject which demands the united attention of all the agriculturists of the land, and which might well demand the attention of the government.;;; We hear complaints from all sections of a serious falling off in the productiveness of the earth, which has been drained of its vitality, and no means adapted for its regeneration.;;; This matter will become serious before many years, and ought to be looked to in time.;;;
