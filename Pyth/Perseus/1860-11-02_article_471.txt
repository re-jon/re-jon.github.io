#TEXT: ;;; the New York Express of Wednesday P. M. Has the following relative to the dry goods trade there:;;; the market is dull and presents but little animation.;;; There is scarcely any business going and orders are mostly from the West.;;; There is;;; the present season would seem to compare favorably with any previous one, though the demand this fall has been light and not up fully to expectations.;;; There is no quotable change in rates, and prices are quite firmly maintained.;;; The retail trade is very satisfactory, and the style and quality of goods are very superior.;;; the following, from the New York Journal of Commerce of Wednesday, P. M., will show the rates of exchange at New York and the principal cities of the Union:;;; Albany...¼ disc.;;; Baltimore...@  disc.;;; Boston...@  disc.;;; Buffalo...¾ disc.;;; Charleston...1 disc.;;; Chicago...@ 1 disc.;;; Cincinnati...¾ disc.;;; Cleveland...¾ disc.;;; Detroit...1 disc.;;; Louisville...@ 1 disc.;;; Milwaukee...1¼ @ disc.;;; Mobile...¾ @ 1 disc.;;; Nashville...1 disc.;;; New Orleans...@ ½ disc.;;; Philadelphia...½ disc.;;; Pittsburg...disc.;;; Richmond...¾ @ 7/8 disc.;;; Savannah...¾ @ 1 disc.;;; St. Louis...1 disc.;;; The Chicago Tribune of Saturday says:;;; The depreciation in State stocks is causing some slight talk with regard to Illinois and Wisconsin currency, the great bulk of which is secured by Missouri bonds.;;; But thus far there is not much occasion for alarm.;;; The auditor will doubtless take good care that the securities are made good whenever occasion requires.;;; The Cincinnati Gazette thus reviews the market:;;; All the houses reported a full supply of money to-day, there being an increase, in some cases, as compared with yesterday.;;; The offerings of paper were, in the aggregate, quite moderate, and good names were in demand at ten per cent. The general dulness that prevails in the produce markets accounts for the comparatively light demand experienced for money.;;; The Boston Weekly Bank Statement. Oct. 3.--Capital stock, $37,731,700; loans and discounts, $63,822 0; specie, $8,089,500; due from other banks, $8,215,500; due to other banks, $9,070,700; deposits, $20,260,000; circulation, $7,543,000.;;; The Cincinnati Gazette of Thursday says:;;; "The movements in financial circles on Saturday, showed an increase in business, but this was caused chiefly by collections, a large amount of paper having matured.;;; This was promptly, and, judging from the comparatively meagre applications for loans, easily met. Nearly all the bankers reported a deficiency in the offerings of good commercial paper, as compared with the supply of capital.;;; The easy features of the market were, in all respects, fully maintained; but there was no giving way in the rates of interest.;;; As we are now upon the eve of the season when there must necessarily be an active demand for money, capitalists are not disposed to invest, except at full rates — say 10 @ 12 per cent. Within the next ninety days, $49,000,000 will be paid out in the West for hogs.;;; During the current month, therefore, the banks will have enough to do in supplying currency, to be used in driving hog and other products.";;;
