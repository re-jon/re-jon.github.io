#HEADER: The city of New York.
#TEXT: ;;; The city of New York.;;; This great American city is paying the unvarying penalty of success in the envy, spite and misrepresentation which are constantly rained upon her head, but which she dashes off with no more effort than the lion shakes the dew drops from his mane, or the Great Eastern scatters the opposing waters from her bow in empty froth and foam.;;; Whatever may be the peculiar defects of New York character, in a political point of view, that city is the most American city in the United States.;;; There is neither sectionalism of feeling, nor provincialism of utterance among the native population of New York.;;; We have heard it often remarked that it is impossible in conversation with an educated New Yorker to decide what part of the country he is from.;;; If it is possible to decide that fact by his sentiments of nationality, it is because New York is the most national of cities, not even excepting the seat of federal government.;;; Of course, these remarks do not apply to the immigrants from New England States to New York, who require a long residence there before they become nationalized either in sentiment or speech.;;; The weak points of New York are unfortunately prominent and conspicuous, and offer a ready handle to those whose inferior enterprise and want of success afford them no more substantial means of retaliation.;;; Her "upper ten thousand" are as ridiculous as her lower ten thousand are coarse and brutal, and she has more than her fair proportion of crime and ruffianism, simply because she is the great commercial city of this continent, the reservoir in which not only all the enterprise but all the villainy of the old world is first poured in America, before it is distributed to other parts of the country.;;; The politicians have availed themselves of that barbarous element which is to be found in all large cities, and thoroughly organized it into depraved and criminal train bands, nominating, in primary caucuses packed to suit their purposes, their own creatures for offices, whilst virtuous and respectable citizens abandon the polls in disgust.;;; The consequence is that, officially as well as socially, New York is made to present an aspect to outsiders which is at once ridiculous and repulsive, but as false to her real character as it is possible to conceive.;;; Between the upper and lower strata of New York society, may be found half a million of as industrious, intelligent and orderly a population as the sun shines on. The Duke of Newcastle, who, as well as all the royal party, must have been thoroughly nauseated with the intense vulgarity of the foolish aristocracy at the ball, were enthusiastic in their admiration of the New York People, who lined the vast thoroughfares of that city on the arrival of the Prince, the Duke declaring that he had never seen a grander spectacle.--We can well believe it. Soldiers and shows they had seen many times in far greater numbers than America could exhibit, but we doubt whether that or any other royal party ever before passed in review three miles of as wide awake, well dressed, and manly a population.;;; If the Union of these States shall ever be dissolved, there is at least one city in it whose skirts will be clear, and that is â€” New York.--From the first moment to the last of the Government, she can show a clean hand on that subject.;;; There never has been an hour when the taint of abolitionism or of treason has touched her heart.;;; At this moment, amid the boiling sea of sectional passions, she is the only firm and stable object in the flood, and stands the Pharos of the storm-tost shore, the constellated lights of the Union still shining brightly amid the surrounding darkness, and giving the only rays of cheer and guidance that now break upon the troubled sea. We predict that this patriotic and chivalrous metropolis will maintain its character to the last, and if she loses all else in this contest, will not lose her Honor.;;;
