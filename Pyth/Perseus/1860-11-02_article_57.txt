#TEXT: ;;; Horrible suicide;;; --A Man Burns Himself to Death.--The suicide of James Black, an innkeeper at New Berwick, Canada, by burning, has been mentioned.;;; The Journal gives the particulars of this terrible case of self-destruction:;;; Black had kept a tavern for some twenty years in Puslinch; about a year ago, in one of his fits of the "blues," he beat his wife till her life was despaired of, but, through great care, she recovered.;;; He rented the tavern and removed to Mount Forest and started in business as a butcher, which did not prosper with him. A few months ago he removed to Clinton, on the line of the Buffalo and Huron railway, where his family are at present.;;; He came here on Saturday week, and at first appeared very unsettled, and told some of his acquaintances that this would be the last time they would meet â€” they had better shake hands.;;; The week passed on till Saturday morning, when he was noticed going into a field where some boys were burning brush, and sat down on the burning pile till all his clothes were burned off him. The boys gave the alarm, when two persons came and dragged him off, but he still persisted in going on. They tried to take him off a second time, but he threatened them, when one ran for assistance, and with some others, got him off, but he still wanted to remain on, saying that was his doom.;;; He was then entirely roasted, not a particle of clothing remaining on him. He bore it all without any signs of torture, and lingered on for about eight hours, when death came to his relief.;;;
