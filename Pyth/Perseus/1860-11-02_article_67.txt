#TEXT: ;;; Narrow escape.;;; --The mail train of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, which is detained by the washing away of the bridges some distance above Newbern, made a very narrow escape from serious damage Monday night. The train had crossed a bridge, against which the swollen stream was fiercely rushing, and proceeded about half a mile, when another was reached, which it was deemed prudent to examine before attempting to pass.;;; While the conductor was engaged in the examination, the engineer, who remained on the engine, felt it sinking beneath him, and, with remarkable presence of mind, commenced to back his train.;;; Scarcely had he removed from the spot, when the embankment was swept away.;;; A moment's delay, and all on board would probably have met a fearful death.--The train was backed until the first bridge was reached, and that, too, was found to be gone.-- Lynchburg (Va.)
