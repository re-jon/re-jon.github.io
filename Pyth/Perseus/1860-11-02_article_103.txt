#TEXT: ;;; Miss Richings' Benefit.;;; --The accomplished actress who has achieved so many dramatic triumphs in Richmond, appears before the public to-night as a beneficiary, and we expect to see a brilliant audience at the Theatre.;;; The play selected for this occasion is the comedy of "Extremes," which has heretofore been received with marked favor, and which, as it contains some rich scenes from American political life, is now peculiarly appropriate.--Miss Caroline Richings will sing some of her best songs, and her father will play that fine character which is emphatically his own, of Mark Mayberry.;;; The piece is well cast, and will be produced with more than usual care.;;; We sincerely hope that Miss Richings will have as good a benefit as she deserves; and if this hope is fulfilled, she will have a crowded house.;;;
