#TEXT: ;;; To Drive away rats.;;; --A correspondent of the Gardeners' Monthly says:"I tried the effect of introducing into the entrance of their numerous holes, runs, or hiding places, small portions of chloride of lime, or bleaching powder, wrapped in calico and stuffed into the entrance holes, and thrown loose by spoonfuls into the drain from the house.;;; This drove the rats away for a twelvemonth, when they returned to it. They were treated in the same manner, with like effect.;;; The cure was most complete.;;; I presume it was the chlorine gas, which did not agree with their old factories.";;;
