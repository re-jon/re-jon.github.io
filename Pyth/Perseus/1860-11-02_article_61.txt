#TEXT: ;;; Financial Commotion.;;; --There was some commotion in the city yesterday, in business and monetary circles, on account of the announcement in the morning of the suspension of the banking house known by the title of Josiah Lee &amp; Co., situated on the northeast corner of Baltimore and Calvert streets.;;; The house remained closed after the usual hour of opening such institutions, and the news soon spread, occasioning much comment and surprise.;;; During the morning depositors and others gathered in the bank, and various statements were afloat as to large individual losses by the suspension.;;; It was known also that the bankers, Appleton &amp; Co., had suspended, but no considerable depositors appeared to be involved in that.;;; The house of Josiah Lee &amp; Co., though an old one, is composed now of entirely different parties from those originally comprised in the title of the firm.;;; The present members are Messrs. Jerard and George Philip Gover, who, with Mr. George S. Reese, (not long since withdrawn,) succeeded the late James H. Carter and Wm. F. Dalrymple two or three years ago. The original founders of the house were Messrs. Lee &amp; Johnson.--Balt. Sun.;;;
