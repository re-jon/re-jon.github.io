#TEXT: ;;; "Let her Rip.";;; --Capt. Kilmer, of the ship Othello, tells a good story of the time when he was going to California with a gentleman crew, at the time of the gold fever.;;; It appears that his crew was composed mostly of students from some college in the interior of New York â€” all intelligent young men, and of wealthy families, and treated very kindly by the captain and his officers.;;; While off Cape Horn, on her passage out, the ship encountered a very heavy gale, accompanied by hail and snow; and after lying to for many hours under nothing but close-reefed main top-sail, it became necessary to take in even that sail.--All the  "boys" were safely stowed below in the forecastle, when the mate went forward and sung out, "Come on deck, all of you, and furl this main-topsail." Surprised, after the lapse of a few minutes, in not seeing the crew come up, the mate again went forward and said, "If you don't come on deck soon the top-sail will blow away."  "All right, Mr. Sherman," was the reply, "please tell the Captain that we have concluded to let the topsail blow away, and we'll pay for it.";;;
