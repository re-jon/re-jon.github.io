The wounded man survived but twenty-four hours after receiving the wound.;;; The next day the war party of these same Indians murdered a boy of Louis Ganards, at the Mormon Crossing of the North Platte, thirty miles above this post, and stole four horses at the North Platte Bridge, five miles below the Mormon Crossing.;;; The murdered boy was at the time holding horses for his father.;;;
