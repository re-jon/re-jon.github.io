#TEXT: ;;; Thanksgiving day.;;; --We are not in favor of the Puritanic custom of appointing a day of Thanksgiving, by the proclamation of the Governor; for, however excellent its purpose may be, there is nothing virtuous in its observance.;;; In the land of the Yankees, whence the custom sprung, it is a day of gormandizing and frolicking, utterly at variance with all thoughts of gratitude for blessings bestowed.;;; Still, there is something pleasing in the idea of the assembling of a congregation of people, uninfluenced by an Executive mandate, to return thanks for the various mercies which have caused the plants to grow in beauty, matured the grain and crowned all with a kindly harvest.;;; When the well-filled barns of the husbandman bespeak his thrift, and plenty smiles abroad, it is surely a proper time for those who participate in the general bounty to make their gratitude manifest.;;; Yesterday was thus observed by the Episcopal Church in this city.;;; Divine service was held at St. James' Church, and an appropriate sermon delivered by the assistant rector, the Rev. Mr. Deshiel.;;; We devoutly hope that the clouds impending over this fair Republic may disappear, and that to the end of time her inhabitants may have cause for true thanksgiving in the reign of peace, plenty and prosperity.;;;
