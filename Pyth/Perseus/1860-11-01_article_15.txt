The forests of Arostook and the gulches of California are equally familiar with its jingle; by the shores of the Chesapeake, and by the pictured rocks of Lake Superior it soundeth.;;; An amusing anecdote is told, which happened lately at a St. Louis theatre:;;; The orchestra played "Dixie," when the curtain rose and the play began.;;; But the audience would not listen.;;; The cry of "Dixie" ran through the house from pit to gallery, completely drowning the voice of the actor.--He made several ineffectual attempts to be heard, and left the stage.;;; The old manager appeared, flushed with anger, and, in an excited voice, exclaimed: "Gentlemen, what means all this ill-mannered confusion !-- What do you want?" Immediately a hundred voices cried out "Dixie." "Well, you can't have it. "You've had 'Dixie' once tonight, and you'll have 'Dixie' no more."

A deafening shout for "Dixie" met him from the audience, and, after stammering and stuttering for a few moments, he left the stage.;;; The curtain dropped, the orchestra played "Dixie," and the play progressed without further interruption.;;;
