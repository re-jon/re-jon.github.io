#TEXT: ;;; The election Fraud in Philadelphia--Conviction.;;; -- the conviction of Wm. Birely, a Judge of Elections, in Philadelphia, on Tuesday, of forging the returns so as to defeat Lehman, the Democratic candidate for Congress, was published yesterday.;;; The Bulletin, of Tuesday afternoon, says:;;; The case was concluded yesterday.;;; At half past 2 o'clock the jury took charge of the case and retired, and at three o'clock no verdict having been agreed upon, the Court adjourned.;;; For a long while after the Court adjourned the immense crowd, which had been in attendance during the day, lingered in the neighborhood of the State-House, discussing the probable issue of the trial.;;; Bets were made as to the verdict, and the length of punishment to be meted out in case of a conviction.;;; During the evening numerous rumors prevailed in the lower part of the city in regard to the rendition of a verdict.;;; This, of course, was not true, but credit was given to the story from the fact that Mr. Birely had been arrested at seven o'clock, and locked up in the Fifth Ward Station-House until near ten o'clock, when Mr. Cassidy succeeded in procuring his release by an order from Judge Thompson.--The difficulty originated from the fact that the officers of Court made a mistake as to the bail of the defendant.;;; The individual who was at first taken to be the one was considered worthless, and hence the warrant of arrest.;;; It was subsequently discovered that the bail was perfectly reliable.;;; This morning the Court-room was again densely packed, and when the jury appeared and took their places in the box the excitement reached fever heat.;;; As Mr. Sharkie was about to lake the verdict, Mr. Brewster, one of the counsel for the defendant, arose and said on behalf of Mr. Birely, he objected to the reception of a sealed verdict.;;; The Act of Assembly made this punishment infamous, and upon the grade of punishment this was a felony, and consequently there could be no separation of a jury without the consent of the prisoner's counsel.;;; Mr. Brewster asked the Judge to make a note of their objection.--The verdict was then taken.;;; It was "guilty.";;; Mr. Brewster then asked the Court to defer action on the verdict until Saturday, and in the mean while if there was any question as to the bail, it might be increased to any amount.;;; Judge Thompson said that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, he could not take bail.;;;
