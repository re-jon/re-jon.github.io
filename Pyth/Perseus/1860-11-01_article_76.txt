#TEXT: ;;; The times are changed.;;; In the course of conversation a few days since, a gentleman observed to us that he had been overhauling an old file of newspapers, in one of which he found the arrival of the Duke of Kent, father of the present Queen Victoria, at Boston, announced without the flourish of a single trumpet.;;; It was while he was Governor General of Canada, (we believe that was the office he held while in America,) and must therefore have been somewhere about the cross of the last century.;;; The royal visitor quietly took up his quarters with the British Consul, and attracted no sort of attention and remark, beyond a short newspaper paragraph or two.;;; Our friend entered into a train of reflections suggested by the contest between this species of reception and the series of ovations which sprung up as if by magic in the footsteps of his descendant, when he lately visited our shores.;;; It was very great, it must be owned, and yet it was not at all strange.;;; The Duke of Kent was but a King's son — the fourth in point of birth, and therefore a very distant expectant of the crown.;;; Between him and the throne, lay three others, big, burly, life-like, in the flower of life, the oldest not being forty years of age. Who could expect that young man to outlive all those sons of Anak, the gigantic George, the gigantic Frederick, and the gigantic William? In point of fact, though the youngest, he was the first of the four to die. But who could have guessed, that a child of his, even, would ever succeed to the throne of his ancestors?;;; All these young giants might marry according to law--one of them actually was married, and the Princess Charlotte was already born.--The chance of Kent, and his posterity, therefore, was beautifully small — like the small end of nothing whittled down, to use a phrase said to have originated with old Ben Hardin--so small that it was scarcely visible, and might be said, almost, not to have existed at all. Now, Lord Brougham tells us, that while the Prince Regent was carrying on his prosecution of his wife — endeavoring to get her decapitated by his Parliament — the people were stirred against him to such a degree of intensity, that had a tolerably popular Prince of the blood offered himself as an aspirant for the crown, he would infallibly have overset the older brother.;;; For many years before that trial — ever since he had been Regent indeed — he had passed along the same street every day, in his carriage, and had scarcely been noticed.;;; Yet no sooner had he been crowned, than the poor Queen and all her wrongs were forgotten, and the same people who had scarcely raised their eyes to look at the chariot and livery of the Regent, could scarcely be kept off the chariot and livery of the King.;;; Yet it was the same chariot, the same equipage, and the same man. So great is the difference between him who is merely a King's son, and him who is King in his own person.;;; Now, it is probable that the Prince of Wales in a very few years will pass through London without attracting more notice than his granduncle did when he was Regent, and that he will stir up the loyalty of John Bull afresh when be becomes King.;;; John has seen so many Kings and Queens that he cares not to look upon royalty in prospect. But Brother Jonathan, while he cares nothing for a man who is only a King's son, with no prospect of being King himself, satiates his curiosity by gazing upon the undoubted heir of royalty.;;; He never saw before a man who was certain to be King, if he only fulfilled the condition of outliving his mother.;;; This is the nearest approach he can make to seeing a King, and he makes the most of his opportunity.;;; The relative situation of the two countries (England and America,) was at the time (1799,) very different from their present relations.;;; We had then hardly recovered from the heartburning which the war of independence had produced.;;; But a few years before, the English had come from Canada, built forts within our borders, and instigated the Indians to make war upon us. So we thought, at least, and there seems to be little cause for distrusting our suspicions.;;; That war-loving Minister, the younger Pitt, was at the head of affairs, and it seems to have been a principle with him never to ask for anything in a civil manner, but to knock the man down first, and take what he wanted.;;; "Britannia ruled the waves" at that time, with a vengeance.;;; "Nelson was then Britannia's God of War," and he ruled the waves with a will.;;; He, and the Minister, and all their subordinates and understrappers, naval, military and judicial, firmly believed that no other nation upon the face of the earth had any rights of their own, and that all the privileges they enjoyed were so many grants from Great Britain, to be resumed at her own good pleasure.;;; Innumerable causes of quarrel necessarily sprung up with our neighbors across the Canadian line, as well as with John Bullon the ocean.;;; We looked upon them as they have always looked upon the French since the wars of Edward III., five centuries ago; that is to say, we regarded them as our natural enemies; and forty-five years of peace have not entirely eradicated that impression.;;; It is hardly wonderful, then, that the arrival of the Duke of Kent created no extraordinary sensation in Boston.;;; A few old Tory families, of pre-revolutionary times, were still in existence.--Doubtless these paid their duty to him, whom they considered the son of their lawful sovereign.;;; But the body of the people would have considered it, no doubt, unpatriotic, anti-republican, and derogatory to their character, for independent opinion and manly bearing.;;;
