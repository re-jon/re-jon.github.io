#TEXT: ;;; Smoke from Gas-Lights.;;; --It is pretty generally supposed that the smoking of ceilings is occasioned by impurity  the gas; whereas, in this case, there is no ection between the deposition of soot and the quality of the gas. The evil ar there from the flame being raised so high that some of its forked points give out smoke, or more frequently from a careless mode of lighting.;;; If, when lighting the lamps, the stop cock be opened suddenly, and a burst of gas be permitted to escape before the match be applied to light it, then a strong puff follows the lighting of each burner, and a cloud of smoke rises to the ceiling.;;; This, in many houses and shops, is repeated daily, and the inevitable consequence is a blackened ceiling.;;; In some houses, the glasses are taken off and wiped every day, and before they are put on again the match is applied to the tip of the burner, and the stop-cock cautiously opened, so that no more gas escapes than is sufficient to make a ring of blue flame; the glasses being then put on quite straight, the stop-cocks are gently turned, until the flames stand out at three inches high.;;; When this mode of management is pursued, few chimney-glasses will be broken, and the ceilings will not be blackened for years.;;;
